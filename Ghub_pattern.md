## 1. Introduction
> Our project involved designing a custom desktop PC build within a budget of P60,000 with an allowance of +/- 5%. The main goal was to create a build that is affordable yet balanced in terms of performance, while ensuring that the selected components are compatible with one another.

> We specifically targeted a build suitable for 1080p gaming, everyday productivity, and general-purpose use such as programming, editing, schoolwork, and other similar tasks. With that in mind, we focused our budget on the CPU and GPU as these components directly impact the PC’s gaming performance and multitasking capabilities. The final PC result is a build that provides strong performance for its price point, while also leaving room for future potential upgrades.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-13400 (LGA1700) works with Asus Prime B760M board (LGA1700 socket). Additionally, not all B760 motherboards support DDR5 RAM, but this specifically has support for both DDR4 and DDR5.   
- **CPU Cooler**:  
- **Memory**: 
- **Storage**: 
- **Video Card**: 
- **Power Supply**: 
- **Case**:

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱60,000.00 (+/-5%) [₱57,000-₱63,000] 
- **Final Total**: ₱61,185.00  
- ✅ Within budget   
- Notes on trade-offs
  - Prioritized GPU over CPU. Specifications called for tuned graphics and high performance for AAA games. Graphics cards are more capable for activities like these.
  - HDD was not considered due to the availability of better storage devices (SSD).
  - The case has integrated fans, hence no need to purchase separate case fans.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
> Prices listed on PCPartPicker seemed to be much cheaper compared to those offered by local vendors in Manila. Factors such as import taxes, shipping fees, and higher retailer markups in the local market may have caused an increase in price in the local market. To address the risk of underestimating costs, the group had searched for local prices of potential components and documented them in a shared spreadsheet. This approach allowed our group to align our budget planning with accurate, location-specific pricing.


- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
> Some popular components were not available from local vendors, which prevented us from including them in our build. As a result, we had to search for alternative parts that were locally available. We also faced challenges in finding more affordable options that still met our desired specifications. This required us to critically evaluate which performance features we should prioritize or compromise on. Through additional research, we were able to identify alternative components with similar performance to our initial choices, helping us adapt the build to local availability without straying too far from our original plans.

- What the group learned about PC components and system design  
> Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into the importance of component compatibility. We realized that even a single incompatible part could disrupt the entire build. Additionally, having a clear definition of our priorities from the start, whether we were aiming for high performance, a visually aesthetic build, a strict budget, or a balance of all three, would help guide our decisions and avoid unnecessary compromises in the creation of our PC. We also learned how to strike a balance between performance, cost, and upgrade potential. Lastly, we came to understand that trade-offs are often unavoidable. Overall, with careful planning and smart decision-making, it's possible to maximize the overall value and performance of a PC build even when working within a limited budget.
